== Day 17

This solution is written in python.
We use pipenv for dependency-management.

Run using:

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ python solution.py
```
The task is to simulate a cellular automaton in 3d.

=== First Star

We know that the boot-process is 6 cycles,
so the state after 6 cycles will fit into a box of lengths 20x20x13
(the input is 8x8x1 boxes and in each cycle the structure can grow by 1 in each dimension (positively and negatively)).


=== Second Star
